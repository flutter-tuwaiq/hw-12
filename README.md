Flutter app with the MyApp class as the root widget. The MyApp widget returns a MaterialApp as the top-level widget, which provides the app's title and theme.

Inside the MaterialApp, we define a Scaffold widget as the home screen. The Scaffold widget provides the app's basic structure, including an AppBar at the top.

The body property of the Scaffold widget contains a Center widget, which centers its child widget both horizontally and vertically. In this case, the child is a Text widget with the text "shuruq" and a font size of 24.
